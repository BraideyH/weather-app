# Weather Application

## Description


This application provides the user with the current weather conditions and a five day forecast for any city provided by the user. Once the user has given a city name, the app will provide the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The page will also show the user what these conditions look like over the next five days.


## Installation

To run this site, the user must first open any internet browser and supply it with the URL leading to the webpage.

## Usage

To effectively use this application, one must first specify the required field and choose a city to search. Once this step is completed, the user may click the "Search" button. Once completed, the desired city's current weather conditions and the conditions of the next five days will be displayed.
